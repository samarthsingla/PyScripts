ArcadeJump [BETA] (Windows)

1) Setup:
	> You just had to unzip the folder which you already did!
	> Don't move or delete the two folders: "resources" and "savedata", the game would not run otherwise.
	> Run the game file (ArcadeJump[BETA].exe) and grant permission (if prompted) to play the game. The file is 100% safe and contains no malware.

2) Controls:
	> Move your mouse to control the game.
	> That's all. Really.

3) In Game:
	>The first screen you see is the difficulty selection screen.
	>The game has 3 difficulty levels (read further to know the differences between them):
		>Easy 
		>Medium 
		>Veteran
	>The highscore for each difficulty level is recorded separately. (This means you have different highscores in different difficulty modes.)
    >What you have to do is avoid the orange parts (obstacles) while taking the powerups (explained below).

4) Scoring:
	>Pass a disc and you get 100 points.
	>Pass 2 discs without bouncing in between and you get 200 points.
	>And so on....

5) Difficulty modes:
	>Easy:
		>Recommended when you are playing for the first few times.
		>Has longer durations for powerups (read below: Powerups)
	>Medium: 
		>Recommended when you have got the hang of it.
		>Has shorter powerup durations.
		>The ball bounces a little faster than in easy mode.
		>The level length is longer.
	>Veteran:
		>Not recommended (jk, it's not that difficult)
		>No powerups at all
		>The ball bounces fast, you'll need to lower you reaction times!
		>The level length is the longest.

6) Powerups:
	>The game has 2 powerups (more may come in future updates):
		>Slow Motion (Blue bar in the game):
			>The ball's falling speed slows down but your horizontal speed doesnt. Get those extra points by passing discs without bouncing!
			>Lasts for different durations in different modes.
			>Has drop chances: 10% per disc in Easy and 7% in Medium

		>Invincible (Green Bar in the game):
			>Zoom past the discs without colliding.
			>Has drop chances : 9% per disc in Easy and 7% in Medium
			>Durations different in different modes.

7) Other important things you must know:
	>The ball spins when you move it around, and this rolling leads it to slip when bouncing.
	In other words, the ball is affected by its own spin when bouncing, just like when you spin a tennis ball and let it bounce on the floor.

	>This effect is magnified in the Medium mode and even more in the Veteran mode. So be careful, situations become unpredictable!

Coming Soon:
    >Online game save feature.

> If the game lags a lot, forgive me for poorly optimizing it, I am working to optimize it and will inform you once it gets better.

Further information: The game is made purely in Python with the help of the PyGame library. No Game Engine was used.
